## Introduction

Connect the Dots is a two player game, based on the classic pen and paper game of the same name.


## How to play
Players take turns to 'Connect the Dots' and create boxes. The person to draw the line and finish the square claims it. They then get another go to place one more line. Then the game continues until all squares are claimed. 
Once all the squares are claimed, the game ends in a win/lose or draw. 

The player with the most squares is the winner. The loser and their family are outcast by the community at large, never to return...

## Build
HTML, CSS and jQuery/Javascript. Sanity. Tears.

## Challenges
Pretty much everything starting with a 'J'.
 
Having one div data-value contained within two nested arrays x200, and then making them do stuff was a much bigger challenge than I thought it would be. I was initially given a 70% chance I'd finish... I think that was generous. But a kind code-wizard called Alex came along and fixed pretty much everything I'd managed to do. Which was nice.

There is still a bug where if two squares are completed at the same time, each player wins one, instead of just the player who completed the line. It's not a feature.

## WTF (Well that's Fantastic!)
I personally think it looks pretty good. Minimal styling and a subtle color pallette. The amount of divs and getting them into position was a challenge (well, everything was tbqfh), and getting them to stay was a bigger one. But I did it all by myself!

It looks simple, but is a toiling mess beneath... just like it's creator.

## Future plans?

I'd like kill the bugs, make a nice alert that tells you who has won. Maybe get the styling fully realised.
