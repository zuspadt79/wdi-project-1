CODE

2 player game (maybe A.I if I have time).
create 10x10 clickable grid. possibly in jQuery?
clickable divs? Dots outlining the corners of the squares.

when a player clicks between 2 dots, have a line
drawn between them.
when all 4 side of a square is completed, fill with
a corrispoding player colour.
if a square gets completed, that player goes again.

once the entire grid is full, the player with the most 
squares filled is the winner.

player x wins! play again/reset?


  - set up a 10x10 grid
  - set up click function
  - record turns
  - on completed square add one to player score
  - on completed square allow player another go
  - include reset/play again button
  -  possible ai????
